Assignment 1:

Attributions: Going over the assignment during class helped me figure out where I got stuck. Also, Tiffany and Emily helped me through a couple issues as well. Basically the whole class and instructors and TA's helped me through this.

Assignment 2:

Attributions: Pat helped me with getting the categories/authors in my drop downs. Also, the code review was helpful with getting my filters to work. Jonathan helped me get the functionality of my filters working. For my tab I used an article that I believer Miranda posted on Slack to help me get it working, http://www.mkyong.com/jquery/how-to-use-css-and-jquery-to-hide-and-show-tab-content/.

Assignments 3/4/5:

Attributions: Brook was kind enough to put up the class code for us to use to get our blogs current with where we should be through assignment 5. I used it because I had gotten behind and he suggested we use it so we can better focus on the assignments going forward. A big thanks to Brook for doing that, it helped me a lot.
