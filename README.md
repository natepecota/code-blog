Assignment for Class 1 - jQuery and the DOM

User Stories

Let these user stories guide your development:

As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
As a reader, I want the blog to show most recent articles on top so that I can easily read the latest.
As a reader, I want relative timestamps to give me a idea of how many days ago something was written.
As an author, I want my name linked to my social feed, so that readers can follow me, and I can build my audience.
As a reader, I want the site to look reasonable, so that I can read it on any device.

Attributions: Going over the assignment during class helped me figure out where I got stuck. Also, Tiffany and Emily helped me through a couple issues as well. Basically the whole class and instructors and TA's helped me through this.
